## Non-Negotiables

- Always show the item details before approving or rejecting. Never blind-approve.
- Rejections require a reason. Approvals do not, but a note is helpful.
- Confirm with the user before executing approvals — especially bulk operations.
- Present items sorted by priority: highest dollar amount first.
- Amounts vary by endpoint: bills are in **cents** (divide by 100), reimbursements are in **dollars**, transactions are formatted strings ("$135.40").

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch all pending items

Run these in parallel to build the full approval queue. **Paginate each endpoint until there are no more results** — a single page may not return everything.

```bash
# Pending transactions (paginate with --next_page_cursor)
ramp transactions list --transactions_to_retrieve transactions_awaiting_my_approval \
  --agent --page_size 50

# Pending bills (paginate with --page_cursor)
ramp bills pending --agent --limit 50

# Pending reimbursements (no cursor pagination — use --limit)
ramp reimbursements pending --agent --limit 50

# Pending requests (paginate with --start; --thoughts is required)
ramp requests pending --thoughts "Reviewing all pending requests" --page_size 50 --agent
```

For each endpoint, check `pagination.next_cursor` in the JSON envelope. If it is not null, re-run the command with that cursor value (via `--next_page_cursor` for transactions, `--page_cursor` for bills, `--start` for requests) until all pages are fetched. Note: `reimbursements pending` does not support cursor-based pagination — it only has `--limit`, so increase the limit if you need more results. Aggregate results before presenting.

### Step 2: Present the queue

Summarize what's pending:

```
Approval queue: 14 items ($23,450 total)

Bills (4 items, $8,200):
  $3,500  HighSpot        Invoice #1234    Due 2026-03-28
  $2,500  Cometeer        Invoice #5678    Due 2026-04-01
  ...

Reimbursements (6 items, $2,100):
  $  520  Michael Scott   Uber rides       Submitted 2026-03-20
  $  312  Oscar Martinez  Office supplies  Submitted 2026-03-22
  ...

Transactions (3 items, $12,500):
  $5,000  Dana Alhasawi   AWS              2026-03-15
  ...

Requests (1 item, $650):
  ...
```

### Step 3: Review and act

For each item the user wants to act on, get details first:

```bash
# Bill details
ramp bills get {bill_id} --agent

# Transaction details
ramp transactions get {transaction_uuid} --agent

# Transaction missing items (if relevant)
ramp transactions missing {transaction_uuid}

# Reimbursement details (use list with specific UUID)
ramp reimbursements list --reimbursement_uuids '["{uuid}"]' --include_policy_assessment --agent
```

### Step 4: Execute approvals

```bash
# Approve a transaction
ramp transactions approve {transaction_uuid} --action APPROVE --thoughts "Reviewed — within policy"

# Reject a transaction (reason required)
ramp transactions approve {transaction_uuid} \
  --action REJECT_AND_REQUEST_CHANGES \
  --thoughts "Missing receipt and over budget" \
  --user_reason "Please attach the receipt and update the memo"

# Approve a bill — not yet available via CLI.
# Bill approvals must be done in the Ramp app: https://app.ramp.com/bills

# Approve a reimbursement
ramp reimbursements approve {reimbursement_uuid} --action approve

# Reject a reimbursement
ramp reimbursements approve {reimbursement_uuid} --action reject \
  --user_reason "Receipt doesn't match the claimed amount"

# Approve a request
ramp requests approve {request_uuid} --action APPROVE --thoughts "Approved — within team budget"
```

### Step 5: Add comments (optional)

Leave a comment on any Ramp object for context:

```bash
ramp general comment {object_uuid} \
  --ramp_object_type transaction \
  --message "Approved — this covers the Q1 offsite catering"
```

Valid object types: `bill`, `booking_request`, `card`, `payee`, `provisional_bill`, `reimbursement`, `spend_intent`, `spend_request`, `ticket`, `transaction`, `vendor_payment`.

## Bulk Approval

When the user wants to approve multiple items at once:

1. Present all items with amounts and details
2. Ask: "Approve all N items, or would you like to review individually?"
3. If bulk: confirm once, then execute sequentially
4. Report results: "Approved 12/14 items. 2 failed: [reasons]"

## Transaction Approval Actions

| Action | When to use |
|---|---|
| `APPROVE` | Item is within policy, receipt/memo present |
| `REJECT_AND_REQUEST_CHANGES` | Needs corrections — missing memo, wrong coding, etc. |
| `REJECT_AND_REQUEST_FULL_REPAYMENT` | Personal expense or policy violation requiring repayment |

## Example Session

```
User: What needs my approval?

Agent: Let me check all your pending queues.
> ramp transactions list --transactions_to_retrieve transactions_awaiting_my_approval --agent --page_size 50
> ramp bills pending --agent --limit 50
> ramp reimbursements pending --agent --limit 50
> ramp requests pending --thoughts "Checking approval queue" --page_size 50 --agent

Approval queue: 6 items ($4,350 total)

Bills (2 items, $2,700):
  $2,200  HighSpot        Invoice #4401    Due 2026-03-28
  $  500  Cometeer        Invoice #882     Due 2026-04-01

Reimbursements (3 items, $1,430):
  $  520  Michael Scott   Uber rides       Submitted 2026-03-20
  $  312  Oscar Martinez  Office supplies  Submitted 2026-03-22
  $  598  Jan Levinson    Flight change    Submitted 2026-03-23

Transactions (1 item, $220):
  $  220  Dana Alhasawi   DoorDash         2026-03-15

Want to review individually or approve all?

User: Approve the bills and reimbursements. Let me see the transaction first.

Agent: I can approve the reimbursements now. Bills must be approved in the Ramp app — I'll send you the links.
> ramp reimbursements approve reimb-001 --action approve
> ramp reimbursements approve reimb-002 --action approve
> ramp reimbursements approve reimb-003 --action approve

3 reimbursements approved. For the 2 bills, approve them here:
  https://app.ramp.com/bills/bill-001
  https://app.ramp.com/bills/bill-002

Now let me get details on that DoorDash transaction:
> ramp transactions get txn-001 --agent
> ramp transactions missing txn-001

DoorDash $220 — Dana Alhasawi, 2026-03-15
Memo: "Team lunch"  |  Receipt: attached  |  Accounting: complete

User: Approve it

Agent: > ramp transactions approve txn-001 --action APPROVE --thoughts "Team lunch — receipt and memo present"
Done. Approval queue is clear.
```

## When NOT to Use

- **Uploading receipts** — use receipt-compliance
- **Editing transaction memos or categories** — use transaction-cleanup

## Gotchas

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Bill amounts are in cents | Divide by 100 for display |
| Reimbursement amounts are in dollars | Display as-is |
| Transaction amounts are formatted strings | Strip "$" and "," for sorting/totaling |
| `requests pending` requires `--thoughts` | Always include it — describe what you're doing |
| `bills approve --action_type` is free text | Use "APPROVE" or "REJECT" — not an enforced enum |
| No undo for approvals | Confirm with user before executing. Use `-n` for dry runs on write commands. |
| Pagination varies | Check `pagination.next_cursor` in envelope. Pass it via `--next_page_cursor` (transactions), `--page_cursor` (bills), `--start` (requests). Reimbursements: `--limit` only. |
